The project aims to address the issue of information dissemination regarding 
government schemes to ensure their successful implementation. The success of any 
government scheme relies on its widespread utilization by the intended beneficiaries. 
However, if people are unaware of the schemes announced by the government, the 
primary goal of those schemes cannot be fulfilled. Therefore, it is crucial to effectively 
convey scheme information to the relevant individuals in a timely manner. To achieve 
this, we are developing a platform that leverages machine learning and web 
technologies to provide personalized information and alerts about applicable 
government schemes across different sectors. The core idea is to gather user-provided 
information regarding their interests and occupation and utilize machine learning 
algorithms to match this data with relevant scheme criteria. By doing so, we can 
ensure that users receive information tailored to their specific needs and 
circumstances. Web technologies will play a pivotal role in creating an accessible and 
user-friendly platform. Our website or application will enable users to input their 
information, browse through available schemes, and receive personalized alerts. 
Features such as search functionality, filtering options, and notifications will keep 
users informed about new schemes or updates relevant to their interests. 
In summary, our project aims to bridge the information gap between government 
schemes and the people who can benefit from them. By utilizing machine learning 
and web technologies, we aim to create a user-centric platform that effectively 
delivers scheme information and alerts. Through this endeavor, we hope to increase 
the utilization of government initiatives by ensuring that applicable individuals are 
well-informed about the schemes available to them.
